X.Y.Z

X is increasing if a release contains major UI/functionality update, for example: new interface design/layout;
New project starts with version 0.1 and minor version is increasing with development;
Y is increasing if a release contains minor changes in UI or just introduces some new feature, or some feature redesign/functionality update which will affect user;
Z is increasing if a release contains just a bug fix, dependencies update or some application internal changes, so no new functionality introduced to user;

If a project contains all planned functionality for version 1.0 the version should be changed to 1.0.
